**************** What is DOLFIN_benchmark ******************

DOLFIN_benchmark allows to automatically benchmark various solver/preconditioner options in the Python interface to FEniCS/DOLFIN.

It works by overwritting the dolfin.solver and solving the same problem with various different solvers/preconditioners. 
The resulting timings are then sorted and the result is reported.

**************** Usage ******************

Copy the file "solver_benchmark.py" in your project directory and import the module in your solver file with:

from solver_benchmark import *

To run benchmark one of your "solve" calls, simply change

solve(...) 

to

solve(..., benchmark = True)

The result of the benchmark will be written to STDOUT.

**************** Example ******************
Run demo_poisson.py to see an example.
