== What is DOLFIN_benchmark == 

DOLFIN_benchmark allows to automatically benchmark various solver/preconditioner options in the Python interface to FEniCS/DOLFIN.

It works by overwritting the dolfin.solver and solving the same problem with various different solvers/preconditioners. 
The resulting timings are then sorted and the result is reported.

== Usage == 

Copy the file "solver_benchmark.py" in your project directory and import the module in your solver file with:

 from solver_benchmark import *

To run benchmark one of your "solve" calls, simply change

 solve(...) 

to

 solve(..., benchmark = True)

The result of the benchmark will be written to STDOUT.

== Exclude a solver/preconditioner ==
Solvers can be excluded from the benchmark with the optional solver_exclude and preconditioner arguments, e.g.

 solve(..., benchmark = True, solver_exclude = ['lu', 'cg'], preconditioner_exclude = ['ilu'])

== Example == 
Run demo_poisson.py to see an example.
